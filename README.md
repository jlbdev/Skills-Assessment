# JLB Skills Assessment


#javascript
For the random hero images, I created a new array and then used math.random in order for one image to randomly be selected.

#Animations

For animations I used AOS animations to allow the images to flip on scroll.

#COLLAGE

For the collage, I created multiple divs and gave them a background image. That allowed me to manipulate their positioning with flex box. I also added images to some of the divs in order to move them around as well.

#Fonts

I could not get the google font to work. I tried it multiple ways and for the life of me it just was not displaying properly. I have imported google fonts and the past and have had no issues, so I am not quite sure why it wasn't working.
