Objective
---------
Develop a webpage that matches the mockup in `./assets/mock.jpg`.

The website should:
  - Look as close to the mockup as possible on the latest versions of the browsers: Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox at a screen width of 1920px.
  - Sections should animate in on scroll. This animation is up to you.
