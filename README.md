The website should:

Comments
----------
When I started working on this project, I had trouble getting Gulp to run correctly. After a few hours of research, I was still unable to minify my .Sass file to the .min.css file. I decided to come back to it later and started working on the layout of the page. I sketched up a layout and started implementing code to HTML/JS and a custom .Css file. After finally getting the layout completed, I went back to see if I could figure Gulp out. It turned out that I had it working the entire time, but it just needed a refresh. However, once I refreshed, all my layout (HTML, CSS, JS) got wiped clean. I restarted the entire project with the correct approach to using Sass.
